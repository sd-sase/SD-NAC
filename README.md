# PacketFence

## What is PacketFence?

PacketFence is a fully supported, trusted, Free and Open Source
network access control (NAC) system. Boasting an impressive feature
set including a captive-portal for registration and remediation,
centralized wired and wireless management, 802.1X support, layer-2
isolation of problematic devices, integration with IDS solutions and vulnerability scanners; PacketFence can be used to effectively secure networks - from small to very large heterogeneous networks.

You want to know who is on your network? You want to give different access to your network based on who is connecting? PacketFence is for you!
